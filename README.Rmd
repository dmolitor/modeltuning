The goal of modelselection is to provide common model selection and tuning utilities in an intuitive manner. Additionally, modelselection aims to be:

- Fairly lightweight and not force you to learn an entirely new modeling paradigm
- Model/type agnostic and work easily with most R modeling packages and various data types including data frames, standard dense matrices, and `Matrix` sparse matrices
- Easily parallelizable; modelselection is built on top of the [`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/) package and is compatible with any of the (many!) available parallelization backends.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `modelselection` with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("dmolitor/modelselection")
```

## Usage

These are simple examples that use the built-in `iris` data-set to illustrate the basic functionality of modelselection. 

### Cross Validation

First we'll train a binary classification Decision Tree model to predict whether the flowers in `iris` are of Species `virginica` and we'll specify a 3-fold cross validation scheme with stratification by Species to estimate our model's true error rate.

First, let's split our data into a train and test set.
```{r Data Prep, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
library(future)
library(modelselection)
library(rpart)
library(rsample)
library(yardstick)

iris_new <- iris[sample(1:nrow(iris), nrow(iris)), ]
iris_new$Species <- factor(iris_new$Species == "virginica")
iris_train <- iris_new[1:100, ]
iris_test <- iris_new[101:150, ]
```

Now, let's specify and fit a 3-fold cross validation scheme and calculate the **F Measure**, **Accuracy**, and **ROC AUC** as our hold-out set evaluation metrics.

```{r Cross Validation}
# Specify cross validation schema
iris_cv <- CV$new(
  learner = rpart,
  learner_args = list(method = "class"),
  splitter = cv_split,
  splitter_args = list(v = 3),
  scorer = list(
    "f_meas" = f_meas_vec,
    "accuracy" = accuracy_vec,
    "auc" = roc_auc_vec
  ), 
  prediction_args = list(
    "f_meas" = list(type = "class"),
    "accuracy" = list(type = "class"), 
    "auc" = list(type = "prob")
  ),
  convert_predictions = list(
    NULL,
    NULL,
    function(.x) .x[, "FALSE"]
  )
)

# Fit cross validated model
iris_cv_fitted <- iris_cv$fit(formula = Species ~ ., data = iris_new)
```

Now, let's check our evaluation metrics averaged across folds.
```{r Check Metrics}
cat(
  "F-Measure:", paste0(round(100 * iris_cv_fitted$mean_metrics$f_meas, 2), "%"),
  "\n Accuracy:", paste0(round(100 * iris_cv_fitted$mean_metrics$accuracy, 2), "%"),
  "\n      AUC:", paste0(round(iris_cv_fitted$mean_metrics$auc, 4))
)
```

### Grid Search

Another common model-tuning method is grid search. We'll use it to tune the `minsplit` and `maxdepth` parameters of our decision tree. We will choose our optimal hyper-parameters as those that maximize the ROC AUC on the validation set.
```{r Grid Search}
# Specify Grid Search schema
iris_grid <- GridSearch$new(
  learner = rpart,
  learner_args = list(method = "class"),
  tune_params = list(
    minsplit = seq(10, 30, by = 5),
    maxdepth = seq(20, 30, by = 2)
  ),
  evaluation_data = list(x = iris_test, y = iris_test$Species),
  scorer = list(
    accuracy = accuracy_vec,
    auc = roc_auc_vec
  ),
  optimize_score = "max",
  prediction_args = list(
    accuracy = list(type = "class"),
    auc = list(type = "prob")
  ),
  convert_predictions = list(
    accuracy = NULL,
    auc = function(i) i[, "FALSE"]
  )
)

# Fit models across grid
iris_grid_fitted <- iris_grid$fit(
  formula = Species ~ .,
  data = iris_train
)
```

Let's check out some details on our optimal decision tree model.
```{r Optimal Tree}
cat(
  "Optimal Hyper-parameters:\n  -",
  paste0(
    paste0(names(iris_grid_fitted$best_params), ": ", iris_grid_fitted$best_params),
    collapse = "\n  - "
  ),
  "\nOptimal ROC AUC:", 
  round(iris_grid_fitted$best_metric, 4)
)
```

### Grid Search with cross validation

Finally, `modelselection` supports model-tuning with Grid Search using cross validation to estimate each model's true error rate instead of a hold-out validation set. We'll use cross validation to tune the same parameters as above.
```{r Grid Search with cross validation}
# Specify Grid Search schema with cross validation
iris_grid_cv <- GridSearchCV$new(
  learner = rpart,
  learner_args = list(method = "class"),
  tune_params = list(
    minsplit = seq(10, 30, by = 5),
    maxdepth = seq(20, 30, by = 2)
  ),
  splitter = cv_split,
  splitter_args = list(v = 3),
  scorer = list(
    accuracy = accuracy_vec,
    auc = roc_auc_vec
  ),
  optimize_score = "max",
  prediction_args = list(
    accuracy = list(type = "class"),
    auc = list(type = "prob")
  ),
  convert_predictions = list(
    accuracy = NULL,
    auc = function(i) i[, "FALSE"]
  )
)

# Fit models across grid
iris_grid_cv_fitted <- iris_grid_cv$fit(
  formula = Species ~ .,
  data = iris_train
)
```

Let's check out some details on our optimal decision tree model.
```{r Optimal Tree Grid Search CV}
cat(
  "Optimal Hyper-parameters:\n  -",
  paste0(
    paste0(
      names(iris_grid_cv_fitted$best_params), 
      ": ", 
      iris_grid_cv_fitted$best_params
    ),
    collapse = "\n  - "
  ),
  "\nOptimal ROC AUC:", 
  round(iris_grid_cv_fitted$best_metric, 4)
)
```

### Parallelization

As noted above, modelselection is built on top of the `future` package and can utilize any parallelization method supported by the [`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/) package when fitting cross-validated models or tuning models with grid search. The code below evaluates the same cross-validated binary classification model using local parallelization.
```{r Parallelization, eval = TRUE}
plan(multisession, workers = 5)

# Fit Cross Validated model
iris_cv_fitted <- iris_cv$fit(formula = Species ~ ., data = iris_train)

# Model performance metrics
iris_cv_fitted$mean_metrics
```

And voila!
